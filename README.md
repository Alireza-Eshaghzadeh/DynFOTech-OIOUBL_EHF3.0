# PEPPOL-BIS-Billing-3.0-EHF3.0-
To create a custom e-Invoice configuration in Microsoft Dynamics Finance & Operations, you can import a standard configuration from Microsoft repositories and create a derived version. You have the option to create or update the mapping. For more information, please refer to the following link: https://dynfotech.com/2021/10/17/e-invoice-in-d365fo-for-norway-part-2-configuration/

For this project, we will create custom e-Invoice configurations based on the standard version to simplify e-invoicing by developing new mappings for sales and project invoices.
